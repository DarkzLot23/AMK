To install and run the AMK script in Ruby, follow these steps:

1. **Install Ruby**: If Ruby is not already installed on your system, you can download and install it from the [official Ruby website](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).

2. **Create a New Ruby Script**: Open a text editor and copy the provided AMK script into a new file. Save the file with a `.rb` extension, for example, `amk_script.rb`.

3. **Run the Script**: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the script, and run the script using the `ruby` command followed by the script filename. For example:

    ```
    ruby amk_script.rb
    ```

4. **Follow the Script Output**: The script will execute the AMK operations and display the results in the terminal. Follow the instructions or observe the output as the script performs memory allocation, retrieval, and deallocation.

5. **Optional: Customize the Script**: You can modify the script to add more complex memory management features or integrate it into larger Ruby applications according to your requirements.

By following these steps, you can install and run the AMK script in Ruby to perform memory management operations.
