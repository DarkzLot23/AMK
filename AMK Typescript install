To implement the Advanced Memory Kernel (AMK) in TypeScript, you'll need to set up a TypeScript project and integrate the AMK functionalities into your codebase. Here's how you can do it along with installation instructions:

### Step 1: Set Up TypeScript Environment

1. **Install Node.js and npm**: If you haven't already, install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) by downloading and running the installer from the official Node.js website: [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Step 2: Create a TypeScript Project

1. **Create a New Directory**: Create a new directory for your TypeScript project.

2. **Initialize npm**: Open your terminal/command prompt, navigate to the directory you created, and run the following command to initialize npm:

    ```bash
    npm init -y
    ```

3. **Install TypeScript**: Install TypeScript as a development dependency by running the following command:

    ```bash
    npm install typescript --save-dev
    ```

### Step 3: Install AMK Library

1. **Install AMK**: Install the AMK library by running the following command:

    ```bash
    npm install amk
    ```

### Step 4: Write TypeScript Code

1. **Create TypeScript Files**: Create your TypeScript source files (e.g., `main.ts`) in the project directory.

2. **Import AMK Library**: In your TypeScript source file, import the AMK library and use its functionalities as needed. Here's an example of how you can use AMK to allocate and free memory:

    ```typescript
    // Import AMK library
    import { MemoryManager } from 'amk';

    // Create MemoryManager instance
    const memoryManager = new MemoryManager();

    // Allocate memory block
    const block1Address = memoryManager.allocateMemory(1024);

    // Retrieve memory block (optional)
    const block1Data = memoryManager.retrieveMemory(block1Address);

    // Free memory block
    memoryManager.freeMemory(block1Address);
    ```

### Step 5: Compile TypeScript to JavaScript

1. **Compile TypeScript**: Compile your TypeScript code to JavaScript using the TypeScript compiler (tsc). Run the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    npx tsc
    ```

### Step 6: Run and Test

1. **Run Your Code**: Once compiled successfully, you can run your JavaScript code using Node.js:

    ```bash
    node dist/main.js
    ```

2. **Test Functionality**: Test your TypeScript application thoroughly to ensure that the AMK functionalities work as expected.

### Step 7: Debugging (if Necessary)

1. **Debug TypeScript Code**: If you encounter any issues, use debugging tools or techniques available in your IDE or editor to debug your TypeScript code.

By following these instructions, you can integrate the Advanced Memory Kernel into your TypeScript project and leverage its memory management capabilities.
