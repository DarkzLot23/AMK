To implement the Advanced Memory Kernel (AMK) in Rust, you'll need to create a Rust project and integrate the AMK functionalities into your codebase. Here's how you can do it along with installation instructions:

### Step 1: Set Up Rust Environment

1. **Install Rust**: If you haven't already, install Rust by following the instructions on the official Rust website: [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

### Step 2: Create a Rust Project

1. **Create a New Rust Project**: Open your terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create your Rust project. Use the following command to create a new Rust project:

    ```bash
    cargo new my_amk_project
    ```

2. **Navigate to Project Directory**: Move into the newly created project directory:

    ```bash
    cd my_amk_project
    ```

### Step 3: Integrate AMK Functionality

1. **Add AMK to `Cargo.toml`**: Open the `Cargo.toml` file in your project directory and add the following line under the `[dependencies]` section to include the AMK library:

    ```toml
    amk = "0.1.0"
    ```

2. **Update Dependencies**: Run the following command to fetch and update the dependencies:

    ```bash
    cargo update
    ```

3. **Use AMK in Your Code**: In your Rust source files (e.g., `src/main.rs`), import and use the AMK functionalities as needed. Here's an example of how you can use AMK to allocate and free memory:

    ```rust
    // Import AMK library
    extern crate amk;

    // Import necessary modules
    use amk::memory_manager::MemoryManager;

    fn main() {
        // Initialize MemoryManager
        let mut memory_manager = MemoryManager::new();

        // Allocate memory block
        let block1_address = memory_manager.allocate_memory(1024).unwrap();

        // Retrieve memory block (optional)
        let block1_data = memory_manager.retrieve_memory(&block1_address).unwrap();

        // Free memory block
        memory_manager.free_memory(&block1_address).unwrap();
    }
    ```

### Step 4: Compile and Run

1. **Compile the Project**: Use the following command to compile your Rust project:

    ```bash
    cargo build
    ```

2. **Run the Project**: Once compiled successfully, run your Rust project:

    ```bash
    cargo run
    ```

### Step 5: Test and Debug

1. **Test Functionality**: Test your Rust application thoroughly to ensure that the AMK functionalities work as expected.

2. **Debug if Necessary**: Use Rust's debugging features, such as `println!` macro or debugging tools, to identify and fix any issues that may arise during testing.

By following these instructions, you can integrate the Advanced Memory Kernel into your Rust project and leverage its memory management capabilities.
